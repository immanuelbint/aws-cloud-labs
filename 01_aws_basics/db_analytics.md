# Databases & Analytics Summary

While with EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, and Amazon S3, we can perform per-file operations, databases provide a much more structured approach. We can even define relationships between your datasets. These databases are all optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes, and constraints.

- Relational Databases - OLTP: Relational Database Service (RDS) & Aurora (SQL).
- Difference between Multi-AZ, Read Replicas, Multi-Region.
- In-memory Database: ElastiCache.

- Warehouse - OLAP: Redshift (SQL).
- Hadoop Cluster: Elastic Map Reduce (EMR).
- Athena: query data on Amazon S3 (serverless & SQL).
- Quicksight: dashboard data (serverless), enables the creation of interactive dashboards and visualizations in a serverless fashion, useful for business intelligence..
- DocumentDB: "Aurora for MongoDB" (JSON - NoSQL database).
- Amazon Managed Blockchain: managed Hyperledger Fabric & Ethereum blockchains.
- Glue: Managed ETL (Extract Transform Load) and Data Catalog service.
- Database Migration: Data Migration Service (DMS) facilitates moving databases from on-premises to the cloud or converting between different database types.
